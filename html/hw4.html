                    <p>Max Emilian Verstappen (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈmɑks vɛrˈstɑ.pə(n)]; born 30 September 1997) is a Dutch and Belgian[3] racing driver, currently competing under the Dutch flag in Formula One for Red Bull Racing. Verstappen has won three Formula One World Drivers' Championship titles, which he won consecutively from 2021 to 2023 with Red Bull.</p>

                    <p>Verstappen is the son of Dutch former Formula One driver Jos Verstappen and Belgian former kart racer Sophie Kumpen [nl]. After a successful karting career—culminating in his record-breaking 2013 season—Verstappen graduated to junior formulae. Progressing directly to FIA European Formula 3, Verstappen broke several records on his way to third in the championship in his rookie season.</p>
                    
                    <p>A member of the Red Bull Junior Team, Verstappen signed for Scuderia Toro Rosso in 2015, aged 17, becoming the youngest driver in Formula One history at the Australian Grand Prix. Following several points finishes with Toro Rosso, Verstappen retained his seat for 2016 before being promoted to parent team Red Bull Racing after four rounds. On debut for Red Bull, aged 18, Verstappen won the Spanish Grand Prix, becoming the youngest-ever driver to win a Formula One Grand Prix.[4][5] After achieving multiple race wins in his 2017 and 2018 campaigns with Red Bull, Verstappen finished third in the 2019 and 2020 World Drivers' Championships.</p>
                    
                    <p>After winning 10 Grands Prix during the 2021 season—overtaking Lewis Hamilton on the last lap of the last race of the season—Verstappen won his maiden title, becoming the first Dutch Formula One World Champion and the 34th overall.[6] Verstappen won the next two championships in 2022 and 2023, overturning the largest points deficit in Formula One history in the former and breaking numerous records across both seasons.</p>
                    
                    <p>As of the 2024 Singapore Grand Prix, Verstappen has achieved 61 race wins, 40 pole positions, 32 fastest laps and 109 podiums in Formula One. In addition to being the youngest Grand Prix winner, he holds several Formula One records, including the most wins in a season (19), the most podium finishes in a season (21), the most consecutive wins (10), and the most consecutive pole positions (8, shared with Ayrton Senna). Verstappen is set to remain at Red Bull until at least the end of the 2028 season.[7] Verstappen was listed in the 2024 issue of Time as one of the 100 most influential people globally.

                        <h2>Personal Life </h2>
                        <p>Max Emilian Verstappen was born on 30 September 1997 in Hasselt, Belgium to Jos Verstappen and Sophie Kumpen [nl].[8][9] Verstappen's parents separated when he was young, after which he lived with his father. His younger sister, Victoria, lived with their mother.[10] Verstappen has three younger half-siblings from his father: a sister from Jos's second marriage and a brother and sister from Jos's current marriage.[11]</p>
        
                        <p>His family has a long association with motor sports: his father is a Dutch former Formula One driver, his Belgian mother competed in karting,[12][13] and his first cousin once removed, Anthony Kumpen, competed in endurance racing and is a two-time NASCAR Whelen Euro Series champion currently serving as the team manager for PK Carsport in Euro Series.[12] Although Verstappen has a Belgian mother, was born in Belgium and resided in Bree, Belgium, 
    he decided to compete with a Dutch racing licence. He stated he "feels more Dutch", having spent more time with his father than with his mother during his upbringing, and was always surrounded by Dutch people while growing up in Maaseik, a Belgian town at the Dutch border.[13] Verstappen said in 2015: "I actually only lived in Belgium to sleep, but during the day I went to the Netherlands and had my friends there too. I was raised as a Dutch person and that's how I feel."[14] In 2022, however, Verstappen stated that he appreciates both sides and is "half-half at the end of the day".[15]</p>
        
                        <p>He competed in Formula One for more than a season before obtaining a road driving licence on his 18th birthday.[16] Verstappen moved to Monaco the day after, in October 2015, and has lived there since and has said it was not for tax reasons.[17] In November 2020, Verstappen bought a Dassault Falcon 900EX aircraft from Virgin Galactic. The aircraft is registered PH-DTF and operated by Exxaero.[18]</p>
        
                        <p>In his free time, Verstappen enjoys sim racing. Having taken part in many sim racing competitions, Verstappen stated that it helps him with his real life racing keeping him "ready to go".[19] Verstappen is a member of Team Redline; a multinational sim racing team.[20] Verstappen is a supporter of FC Barcelona and PSV Eindhoven.[21] Verstappen speaks three languages, Dutch, English and German, the latter of which he learned while karting with Michael Schumacher.[22] In September 2022, he was made an Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau in recognition of his racing achievements.[23]</p>
        
                       
 <p>Verstappen has been dating Kelly Piquet publicly since January 2021.[24]</p>

                    <h2>F1 Career</h2>
           
                        <p>During the first practice session at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, Verstappen replaced Jean-Éric Vergne as part of his preparation for a full-time seat at Toro Rosso in the 2015 season.[67] Aged 17 years and three days, Verstappen was the youngest person in history to participate in a Formula One race weekend.[68] In August 2014, Verstappen joined the Red Bull Junior Team after testing a Formula Renault 3.5 car. He also considered an offer from Mercedes to join their driver development programme.[69].</p>
    
                        <p>Verstappen became the youngest driver to start a World Championship race through joining Toro Rosso's race drivers’ line-up with Carlos Sainz as his teammate, in his Grand Prix debut as a full-time driver at the 2015 Australian Grand Prix at the age of 17 years, 166 days—breaking Jaime Alguersuari's existing record by almost two years.[70] In this first race, Verstappen ran in points-scoring positions until he was forced to retire due to an engine failure.[71] However, at the subsequent race in Malaysia, Verstappen qualified sixth and finished the race in seventh place, scoring his first Formula One points aged 17 years, 180 days, breaking the record of the then-youngest driver to score World Championship points.[72].</p>
                        
                        <p>At the 2015 Monaco Grand Prix, Verstappen was involved in a high-speed collision with Romain Grosjean, after clipping the back of Grosjean's Lotus on the approach to the tight first corner, Sainte Devote, and crashed into the barriers at high speed.[73][74] Verstappen was given a five-place grid penalty for causing the accident, and was branded "dangerous" by Williams driver Felipe Massa.[75]</p>
                        
                        <p>Verstappen continued to regularly finish in the points as well as achieving his best finish of the 2015 season in Hungary by finishing fourth,[76] and equalled this result at the United States Grand Prix.[77] At the end of the season, Verstappen received three awards at the FIA Prize Giving Ceremony, for "Rookie of the Year", "Personality of the Year" and "Action of the Year", for his overtake on Felipe Nasr on the outside of the Blanchimont corner at the Belgian Grand Prix.[78][79]

    </p>
                        
                        <p>Verstappen began the 2016 season at Toro Rosso, again alongside Sainz.[80] Verstappen qualified fifth for the opening race of the season in Australia, but during the race made several radio calls to his team due to frustration at being behind Sainz on track before Verstappen's Toro Rosso came into contact with his teammate's car whilst attempting to pass him with three laps to go, and he eventually finished tenth.[81] Verstappen enjoyed a more successful weekend at the following race in Bahrain, finishing sixth to score Toro Rosso's first-ever points at the Sakhir circuit.[82]
    
    </p>
                        <p>On 5 May 2016, following the Russian Grand Prix, Red Bull Racing announced that Verstappen would be replacing Daniil Kvyat from the Spanish Grand Prix onwards, with Kvyat returning to Toro Rosso.[83] According to Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner, "Max has proven to be an outstanding young talent. His performance at Toro Rosso has been impressive so far and we are pleased to give him the opportunity to drive for Red Bull Racing."[84] After qualifying fourth for the Spanish Grand Prix,[85] Verstappen rose to second behind teammate Daniel Ricciardo on the opening lap after Mercedes teammates Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg crashed out of the race.[86] Verstappen took the race lead as he was placed on a two-stop rather than the same three-stop strategy as Ricciardo, and he held off Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen in the later stages of the race to take his first Formula One victory.[87] By doing so he displaced Sebastian Vettel as the youngest driver ever to win a Formula One Grand Prix at the age of 18 years and 228 days.[5]
    
    </p>
                        <p>In his first eight races with Red Bull, he achieved six top-five finishes, including four podiums.[88]

        During the Belgian Grand Prix, Verstappen collided with Räikkönen at the first corner, pushed Vettel, Räikkönen and Pérez wide at Les Combes, and aggressively blocked Räikkönen on the Kemmel straight.[89] Verstappen was criticised for his driving, with Räikkönen saying that he was "going to cause a huge accident sooner or later." Christian Horner noted that the driving was "on the edge", and that Verstappen will "look at it and learn for future races."[90] In September, Formula One director Charlie Whiting called in Verstappen for a discussion, and later gave him a 'gentle warning' due to his aggressive driving.[91] However, in October, drivers' concerns about Verstappen's defensive tactics led the FIA to disallow moving under braking.[92]
    
    </p>
                        <p>At the 2016 Brazilian Grand Prix, Verstappen qualified fourth.[93] In a rain affected race, he almost hit the barrier after he slid on the main straight due to a loss of traction, causing oversteer.[94] After an additional tyre change from intermediates back to rain tyres, he ran in 16th place with just 15 laps remaining. Verstappen then made several overtakes in quick succession during the closing laps to eventually finish on the podium in third place.[95] He received considerable praise for his performance: rival team Mercedes' team principal, Toto Wolff, labelled it "The Verstappen Show", and described Verstappen's drive as "physics..being redefined".[96][97][98] However, Verstappen came under criticism from four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, who stated that Verstappen had pushed him off the track at the Junção corner late in the race. The race stewards did not share Vettel's view and decided that no reprimand was warranted.[99]

        </figure>
                        <p>During the first 14 races of the 2017 season, Verstappen suffered seven retirements, four due to mechanical issues,[100] and three due to first lap collisions in Spain, Austria and Singapore.[101] Of the races he finished, however, he claimed a third place in China, and in another five races he finished fourth or fifth.
    </p>

    <p>From the Malaysian Grand Prix onward, Verstappen enjoyed a surge of success. He won his second Formula One race at the 2017 Malaysian Grand Prix, a day after his 20th birthday, passing then three-time champion Lewis Hamilton for the lead in the early stages of the race.[102] He finished second in the following race in Japan.[103] He then finished third at the United States Grand Prix, but was classified fourth after his final lap overtake on Kimi Räikkönen was deemed illegal.[104] He won his third Formula One race at the Mexican Grand Prix, after passing Sebastian Vettel on the opening lap.[105]
    </p>

    <p>In the first six races of the season, Verstappen had been involved in at least one incident in each race. In Australia, he qualified fourth but fell behind Kevin Magnussen at the start.[106] In his attempts to retake the position he ran wide multiple times and damaged his car, with a spin causing him to fall further down the order. He recovered to eventually finish the race in sixth place.[107] At the next race in Bahrain, he crashed during qualifying and started in 15th place.[108] He had a productive first lap after which he found himself in the points while challenging Lewis Hamilton. He attempted an overtake on the reigning World Champion at the start of lap two, but collided with the Mercedes driver and suffered a puncture that ultimately led to suspension damage, forcing him out of the race.[109]
    
    </p>

    <p>At the next race in China, Verstappen qualified fifth and had moved up to third at the end of the first lap.[110] Both Red Bull drivers pitted for fresh tyres during a safety car which left them with a tyre advantage over the front-runners ahead. In an overtake attempt on Sebastian Vettel for third place, Verstappen collided with the championship leader, causing him to fall to eighth and receive a 10-second penalty.[111] He recovered to fourth place, with his penalty causing him to be classified fifth. Teammate Ricciardo went on to win the race.[112] In Azerbaijan, Verstappen was embroiled in a race-long battle with Ricciardo for fourth place. After numerous position changes between the two teammates during the race, Ricciardo ran into the back of Verstappen during an overtake attempt from which the Dutchman aggressively defended, causing the retirement of both cars.[113] Both drivers were blamed by the team and reprimanded by the stewards.[114] Verstappen bounced back in Spain with his first podium of the season by finishing third behind the Mercedes drivers, holding off Sebastian Vettel. However, the race was also not without incident as he had run into the back of Lance Stroll during the virtual safety car period, causing minor front wing damage.[115]
    
    </p>
    <p>In Monaco, Verstappen made another error and crashed near the end of the third free practice session in an incident which closely resembled a crash he had at the same spot two years earlier.[116] His team could not repair his car in time for qualifying and Verstappen had to start the race from the back of the grid.[117] Verstappen did not compete and did not set a lap time in qualifying, therefore teammate Ricciardo pressed home Red Bull's advantage at the track by taking pole position and the race win. Verstappen managed to salvage two points by finishing ninth place, overtaking six cars on track.[118] Team principal Christian Horner commented on Verstappen's start of the season, saying he "needed to stop making these mistakes" and that he could "learn from his teammate", while Helmut Marko, head of driver development at Red Bull, said that Verstappen was "too impatient".[117] Verstappen now lay in sixth place in the championship with 35 points, only three points ahead of Fernando Alonso in the McLaren, and 37 points behind his teammate in third, who had taken two wins in the first six races.[119][120]


    
    </p>
    <p>In Canada, Verstappen topped all three practice sessions and qualified third, two-tenths off Sebastian Vettel in pole position.[121] He eventually finished third and set the fastest lap of the race.[122] The following race in France brought him second place.[123] In Austria—Red Bull's home track, he started fourth on the grid, passed Kimi Räikkönen before taking advantage of retirement from Valtteri Bottas and a botched pit-stop strategy by Lewis Hamilton, who later had to retire from fourth place, to claim the fourth race victory of his career.[124] In Britain, Verstappen was plagued by issues, finishing the first practice session early due to a gearbox problem and crashing in the second practice session before retiring from the race due to a brake problem.[125] He would then finish fourth in Germany after strategy errors let a recovering Hamilton get past him as he went on to win the race.[126] Verstappen ended the first half of the season with a retirement in Hungary and was narrowly behind his teammate in the championship due to his own recent resurgence and Ricciardo's unreliability.[127][128]

                        <h2>World Championships</h2>
        
    <p>At the Bahrain Grand Prix, Verstappen topped all the practice sessions and subsequently took a career fourth pole position. This was the first time he achieved back-to-back pole positions.[193] He fought Lewis Hamilton for the race victory, and on lap 53 Verstappen overtook Hamilton, but went off track whilst doing so, resulting in him being instructed by race control to let Hamilton back into the lead and ultimately finishing second behind Hamilton.[194] At the next race, the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, Verstappen qualified third with teammate Sergio Pérez second, marking the first time he was out-qualified by a teammate since the 2019 Italian Grand Prix.[195] At the race start, Verstappen was able to pass both Pérez and pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton to take the lead. He remained in the lead after the first round of pit stops as well as the restart, following the race being suspended on lap 33. Rival Hamilton finished second, reducing his championship lead over Verstappen to one point.[196] In the following Portuguese Grand Prix, Verstappen finished second after a long battle with Lewis Hamilton.[197] At the Spanish Grand Prix, the battle between Verstappen and Hamilton continued, with Hamilton employing a faster two-stop strategy versus Verstappen's one-stop race. This provided Hamilton the advantage of faster tyres, allowing him to overtake Verstappen with several laps remaining in the race. Hamilton took the victory, with Verstappen taking second and the fastest lap, increasing Hamilton's championship lead to 14 points.[198]
    
    </p>
    <p>At the next race in Monaco, Verstappen qualified second behind Charles Leclerc,[199] but Leclerc suffered a driveshaft failure on the way to the grid and was unable to start the race. Verstappen controlled the race from the front on the way to victory. Hamilton (who qualified seventh) finished seventh, though claiming an extra championship point by setting the fastest race lap. The result enabled Verstappen to take the lead in the Drivers' Championship for the first time in his career, by a margin of four points over Hamilton.[200] At the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, Verstappen qualified third behind Leclerc and Hamilton.[201] Verstappen and Hamilton passed Leclerc in the opening laps before Verstappen took the lead by way of a faster pitstop. Verstappen would comfortably hold the lead until lap 46 when he suffered a tyre failure causing him to crash at high-speed and retire.[202] A mistake by Hamilton on the restart dropped him to last place, meaning Verstappen maintained his championship lead.[203] Verstappen took pole for the French Grand Prix.[204] Verstappen's mistake on the first lap allowed Hamilton to take the lead which Verstappen retook during the pit stop phase. Verstappen pitted for a second time from the lead and set after the Mercedes duo, overtaking Hamilton for the lead on lap 52 of 53.[205] He also took the fastest lap point, extending his championship lead to twelve points[206] and achieving the first hat-trick of his career.[207] Verstappen clinched pole position again at the Styrian Grand Prix and led the race from start to finish, to give him his fourth win of the season and further extend his lead to 18 points.[208]
    
    </p>
    <p>Verstappen took pole position at the Austrian Grand Prix, led every lap from start to finish, set the fastest lap, and won the race for his first career grand slam,[209][210] being the youngest to do so.[211] With the win, Verstappen also became the first driver to win three races in three consecutive weekends, starting at the French Grand Prix on 20 June, then the Styrian Grand Prix on 27 June and ending with the Austrian Grand Prix on 4 July.[212][213] At the next race; the British Grand Prix, Verstappen was involved in a high-speed collision at the Copse corner with Hamilton on the first lap. This resulted in a 51 g impact with the barrier.[214][215] He was taken to the Silverstone circuit's medical centre after the crash and was then taken to Coventry hospital for precautionary checks and further assessment, before eventually being discharged at 22:00 local time on Sunday night.[216] Hamilton would go on to win the race, reducing Verstappen's lead in the championship to eight points.[217] At the next race, the Hungarian Grand Prix, Verstappen's car suffered damage in a multi-car collision on lap 1, where Mercedes driver Valtteri Bottas was deemed at fault. He ended the race in tenth which was promoted to ninth after Sebastian Vettel was disqualified. The outcome of the race allowed Hamilton to take the lead of the championship.[218

    </p>

    <p>At the United States Grand Prix, Verstappen took pole position in qualifying, edging Hamilton by 0.209 seconds.[227] Verstappen won the race and extended his lead in the Drivers' Championship to twelve points as Hamilton finished second with the fastest lap.[228] At the 2021 Mexico City Grand Prix, Verstappen qualified third with a gap to pole-sitter Bottas of 0.350 seconds.[229] Verstappen's main rival Hamilton qualified second. At the start, Verstappen took the lead from Bottas and Hamilton into turn 1, and won the race; and as a result extended his lead in the championship to 19 points.[230]
    </p>
    <p>Verstappen and Hamilton were on equal points in the Drivers' Championship going into the final round,[231] the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, with Verstappen leading on countback. Verstappen overtook Hamilton on the final lap to win the race, and his first Formula One World Drivers' Championship.[232][233] Verstappen, who had qualified on pole position by nearly four-tenths of a second, had a slow start off the line at the start of the race and dropped to second place. Verstappen was trailing Hamilton by over ten seconds until a late safety car was called in due to a crash at turn 14 involving Williams driver Nicholas Latifi.[234] The withdrawal of the safety car and the resumption of the race following the safety car period was met with controversy. Race director Michael Masi allowed only a certain number of lapped cars through, which after the race brought from the Mercedes team a protest and stated intention to appeal against the race result, arguing that all lapped cars should be allowed through, Red Bull counter argued that this was not specified by the wording of the regulations. The protest was rejected, although subsequent investigation by the FIA resulted in the wording of the rule being amended for the 2022 season to specify that "all" cars will unlap themselves (at the race director's discretion) rather than "any".[235][236] Verstappen passed Hamilton at turn 5 of the final lap of the race to become the 34th Formula One World Drivers' Champion.[237]</p>
    <p>2022 season: Dominant second title. In March 2022, Verstappen signed a five-year contract extension with Red Bull Racing for the 2023 to 2028 seasons.[7] From this season onward, he would use the number 1 instead of his regular number 33 as the reigning world champion.[238]
