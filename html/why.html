            <h2 id="main-content">Inclusion and Accessibility</h2>
            <p style="color: white;">The goal is to ensure that all individuals, no matter their physical, cognitive, or sensory abilities, 
                can independently and effectively interact with the world around them. This approach not only benefits people with disabilities
                 but also creates more inclusive spaces and experiences for everyone. By considering the diverse needs of users from the 
                 beginning of the design process, Universal Design promotes equality, dignity, and autonomy, ensuring that all individuals 
                 have the opportunity to fully participate in society. Whether it's a building, a website, or a product, when accessibility is 
                 prioritized, it removes barriers, reduces discrimination, and enhances the overall user experience.

            <h2 id="section2">Legal and Ethical Resposiblility</h2>
            <p style="color: white;">In many countries, laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the U.S. mandate accessibility
                 in public spaces, services, and products to ensure that people with disabilities are not excluded from basic rights or 
                 opportunities. Beyond legal compliance, Universal Design reflects a broader ethical commitment to social justice and 
                 equality. It challenges the assumption that people with disabilities are a "special interest group" and instead emphasizes 
                 that accessible design benefits everyone, fostering an inclusive society. Businesses, governments, and organizations that 
                 prioritize Universal Design demonstrate their commitment to diversity, human dignity, and equal opportunity, ultimately 
                 creating a more just and accessible world for all. On top of this aspect this can improve overall success of company and bring in 
                more money which helps everyone who takes apart. </p>

            <h2 id="section3">Demographics</h2>
            <p style="color: white;"> When it comes to disabilities, they are a lot more common then people may think. When it comes to the US we have aboout
                323 million internet users where 42.5 million have disabilities which is a large percentage. Granted not all of these abilities are the same
                so we must design things that can be accessible to all users. Imagine how many people are missing out when just a simple issue on a website 
                can be fixed. About 8% have vision problems and a 30% have mobility impairments which can affect the viewing experience for the user.

            <h3>ADA</h3>
            <p style="color: rgb(7, 6, 6);"> ADA stands for Americans with Disabilities Act. The ADA outlines the bare minimum necessary in 
                order to curb discrimination against people with disabilities, while Universal Design strives to meet the best practices 
                for design.
