                <h2>Synopsis</h2>
       
                    <p>Max Emilian Verstappen (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈmɑks vɛrˈstɑ.pə(n)]; born 30 September 1997) is a Dutch and Belgian[3] racing driver, currently competing under the Dutch flag in Formula One for Red Bull Racing. Verstappen has won three Formula One World Drivers' Championship titles, which he won consecutively from 2021 to 2023 with Red Bull.</p>

                    <p>Verstappen is the son of Dutch former Formula One driver Jos Verstappen and Belgian former kart racer Sophie Kumpen [nl]. After a successful karting career—culminating in his record-breaking 2013 season—Verstappen graduated to junior formulae. Progressing directly to FIA European Formula 3, Verstappen broke several records on his way to third in the championship in his rookie season.</p>
                    
                    <p>A member of the Red Bull Junior Team, Verstappen signed for Scuderia Toro Rosso in 2015, aged 17, becoming the youngest driver in Formula One history at the Australian Grand Prix. Following several points finishes with Toro Rosso, Verstappen retained his seat for 2016 before being promoted to parent team Red Bull Racing after four rounds. On debut for Red Bull, aged 18, Verstappen won the Spanish Grand Prix, becoming the youngest-ever driver to win a Formula One Grand Prix.[4][5] After achieving multiple race wins in his 2017 and 2018 campaigns with Red Bull, Verstappen finished third in the 2019 and 2020 World Drivers' Championships.</p>
                    
                    <p>After winning 10 Grands Prix during the 2021 season—overtaking Lewis Hamilton on the last lap of the last race of the season—Verstappen won his maiden title, becoming the first Dutch Formula One World Champion and the 34th overall.[6] Verstappen won the next two championships in 2022 and 2023, overturning the largest points deficit in Formula One history in the former and breaking numerous records across both seasons.</p>
                    
                    <p>As of the 2024 Singapore Grand Prix, Verstappen has achieved 61 race wins, 40 pole positions, 32 fastest laps and 109 podiums in Formula One. In addition to being the youngest Grand Prix winner, he holds several Formula One records, including the most wins in a season (19), the most podium finishes in a season (21), the most consecutive wins (10), and the most consecutive pole positions (8, shared with Ayrton Senna). Verstappen is set to remain at Red Bull until at least the end of the 2028 season.[7] Verstappen was listed in the 2024 issue of Time as one of the 100 most influential people globally.
