            <p style="color: white;">Universal Design refers to the concept of creating products and environments that are accessible and usable by 
                as many people as possible, regardless of age, ability, or disability. The goal is to ensure that all individuals, no matter the disability, are able to 
                effectivley use and access all parts of the internet. It aims to create accessible, inclusive, and flexible designs that work for all people. </p>

                <h2 id="main-content"> What Disabilities are Impacted? </h2>
                <p style="color: white;">There are various disablities that impact people from a day to day basis when it comes to accessing and using the internet.
                    Some of these include blindness, low vision, deafness, mobility impairments and learning disabilites. Those with blindness and low vision may need screen readers to assist
                    them naviagting the page. Also color contrast is huge for this disability.

                <h2 id="main-content">Real World Examples </h2>
                <p style="color: white;">
                    When it comes to universal design it is a good idea to relate it to the real world. How do we make building and physical objects more accessible? 
                    Some may put ramps instead of stairs so people in wheelchairs can get up easily. Also highways may have signs that are easy to read from a distance 
                    so people can get off at the right exit. Universal Design applies to all aspects of life and not just the internet. Inclusive design is the idea that the 
                    design and acccessibility equals Inclusive Design.

            <h2>Principles of Universal Design</h2>
            <p style="color: rgb(3, 3, 3);">
                The principles of design start from the premise tha there is no typical average, or normal user. Rather there is a basic understanding that the user context
                eill vary widely based on circumstances. This proccess makes sure that any needs arising from differences are met by design. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Equitable Use: The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities. </li>
                <li>Flexibility in Use: The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.</li>
                <li>Simple, Intuitive Use: Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level. </li>
                <li>Perceptible Information: The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.</li>
                <li>Tolerance for Error:The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.</li>
                <li>Low Physical Effort: The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue.</li>
                <li>Size and Space for Approach and Use: Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility</li>
