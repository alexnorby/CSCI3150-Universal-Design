      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>The resort opened in November 1972. The mountain has been operated by several owners. In 1980, it was acquired by Apex Oil Company,[1] who operated the area until 1988, when it was acquired by the Toronto-based Horsham Corporation.[2] In 1997, it was acquired by Intrawest, owner and operator of Whistler and operator of Winter Park.[3] Then, in December 2009, Interwest sold Copper Mountain's operations to POWDR.[4]</p>

      <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Copper Mountain is a mountain and ski resort located in Summit County, Colorado, about 75 miles (120 km) west of Denver on Interstate 70. The resort has 2,465 acres (3.9 sq mi; 10.0 km2) of in-bounds terrain under lease from the U.S. Forest Service, White River National Forest, Dillon Ranger District. It is operated by POWDR..</p>
    <h2>Resort</h2>
    <p>The lodging, dining, and entertainment facilities at Copper Mountain are divided into three villages: East Village, The Village at Copper (AKA Center Village), and West Village (formerly Union Creek). The ski area is most notable as being designated by the National Forest Service as having the most organized skier layout of any ski resort. The beginner runs are located entirely to the west and graduate evenly in difficulty as the lifts progress to the east. They are isolated from the busier and more difficult runs in a natural fashion. Similarly, the intermediate runs are located even more to the east and develop in difficulty in a smooth manner. More difficult runs are to the far east, with the most difficult runs being on the backside. The most southern Tucker Mountain provides only double black diamond runs.

        Olympic medalist Putzi Frandl worked at Copper Mountain as a ski instructor for many years[vague] beginning in 1984.
